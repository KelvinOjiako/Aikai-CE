# This is to check the efficiency of my piece classes soo far

"""
    questions for later:
    (1) is it better to have all the classes in different py-files?
    (2) how to conditionally check for check edge cases in the king class since the board class actually relies on the
            information given by the piece class but to check for those cases i need to have an idea of the board
    (3)
